1. Write a program that asks the user for a string and tests whether it's a
palindrome. If it's a palindrome print “yes”, if not, print “no”.
EX1:
Input:
start
Output:
no

EX2:
Input:
level
Output:
yes


2. Write a program that takes a sorted list as an input and removes the
duplicates.
EX:
Input:
1 1 2 3 4 4 5 6 7 7 8 9
Output:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9


3. Write a Python program that randomly generates a 3-digit number. Ask the
user to guess a 3-digit number. For every digit that the user guessed correctly in
the correct place, they have a "hit". For every digit the user guessed correctly in
the wrong place is a "miss". Every time the user makes a guess, tell them how
many hits and misses they have. Once the user guesses the correct number, the
game is over. print the number of attempts they needed to guess the number.
EX:
if the random number is 427
The program will look like this:
Enter a 3-digit number:
>>> 412
1 hit 1 miss
>>> 413
1 hit 0 misses

and so on until the user guesses the correct number

4. Find the minimum distance between 2 similar numbers in a list.
distance means -> the absolute difference between 2 indexes
EX:
Input:
2 5 3 4 5 2
Output:
3 

Explanation:
There are 2 options:
1-Distance between (2,2) which is 5 - 0 = 5
2-Distance between (5,5) which is 4 - 1 = 3
we want the minimum so we print 3

5. Implement insertion sort.
