1- Find the minimum distance between 2 similar numbers in a list.
distance means -> the absolute difference between 2 indexes

EX:
Input:
2 5 3 4 5 2
Output:
3

Explanation:
There are 2 options:
1-Distance between (2,2) which is 5 - 0 = 5
2-Distance between (5,5) which is 4 - 1 = 3
we want the minimum so we print 3

2- You have a sequence of letters that is repeated infinitely. Print the number of
r's in the first n letters.
Input:
The first line represents the sequence of letters
The second line represents n.

EX:
Input:
rar
10
Output:
7

Explanation:
'rar' is repeated infinitely, we only take the first n letters and check how many r's
are in there. The first n(10 in the example) letters will be 'rarrarrarr'
'r' is repeated 7 times so we print 7.
