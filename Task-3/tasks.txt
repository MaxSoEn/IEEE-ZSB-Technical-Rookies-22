1.You have n (n > 1) bottles of water, each bottle is described by remaining 
volume of water and capacity. You should determine if you can pour all 
remaining water into just 2 bottles. 
Input: 
The first line is n(number of bottles) 
The next n lines contain 2 space-separated integers (remaining volume and 
capacity) 
Output: 
print "Yes" if you can pour all the water into 2 bottles, otherwise print "No".

Breaking the Records | HackerRank
Given an array of Maria's basketball scores all season, determine the number of times she breaks her best and worst records.

6. You are given a number that contains 4 digits with at least two distinct digits. 
Your program should perform the following routine on the number: Arrange the 
digits in descending order and in ascending order (adding zeros to fit it to a 
4-digit number), and subtract the smaller number from the bigger number. Then 
repeat the previous step. Performing this routine will always cause you to reach a 
fixed number: 6174. Your program should return the number of times this routine 
must be performed until 6174 is reached. For example, if num is 3524 your 
program should return 3 because of the following steps: 
(1) 5432 - 2345 = 3087 
(2) 8730 - 0378 = 8352 
(3) 8532 - 2358 = 6174
